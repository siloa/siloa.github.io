In Spring 2020, I was part of a five person team that competed for the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) Imperial Barrel Award. The UT Dallas team, Comet Exploration, recieved **1st place** in the Southwest Section SemiFinals and Honorable Mention at the International Finals. Our team was up against some of the most prestigeous Petroleum Geology universites around the world, so we were honored to have made it to the final round. This is the second time UT Dallas has made it to the international stage. You can read more about the experience in [this article](https://www.utdallas.edu/news/students-teaching/imperial-barrel-2020/).
