#### Stratigraphy and Sedimentology Lab
I have taught the lab section for Stratigraphy and Sedimentology for four years. The lab reinforces lecture concepts such as sedimentary textures and structures, ichnofacies, trace fossils, and creating stratigraphic columns. We take students on two field excursions, one to Lake Murray to look at siliciclastic deposits and another to see the core of the Arbuckle anticline near Turner Falls (both in Oklahoma). At both locations, students are tasked with measuring stratigraphic sections and taking detailed notes that will later be used to interpret the depositional environment and create a professional stratigtaphic column in SedLog or Illustrator.

#### Geocience Animations
I teach an upper level elective course called Geoscience Videos and Animations. In this class I teach students video editing, 2D and 3D keyframe animation, videography, photography, and best practices for communicating science to a non-technical audience. Students are taked with writing a research paper on a topic of their choosing (related to the geosciences) and turning said paper into a video aimed at a non-technical audience. 

Scientific communication is at the core of my research interests. If you are interested in viewing my latest videos, please click on the links below:

#### Petrology Lab
I teach the lab section for Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology. Students learn to recognize various minerals based on their physical and optical properties. They also learn how igneous and metamorphic processes are closely tied to plate tectonics, helping them understand the broader geological context of these rocks and their role in Earth's history. Through hands-on experiences, students become proficient in classifying igneous and metamorphic rocks based on their mineral composition and texture.
