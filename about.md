Hello, my name is Siloa Willis. I am a Doctoral candidate at the University of Texas at Dallas. My research interests inculde plate tectonics and metamorphism, geoscience education, instructional design, and best practices for producing GeoEd videos/animations.

I have multiple years of experience teaching the lab section for Stratigraphy and Sedimentology and Igneous and Metamorphic Petrology, both of which are upper level courses for geoscience majors. I also teach Geoscience Videos and Animations, an upper level elective designed to give students the opportunity to explore science communication on digital platforms. Students will write a research paper on a geoscience topic (of their choosing) and then create a video/animation to explain their topic to a general audience. Students will learn basic video editing skills as well as keyframe animation (using Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects).

### More Information

Outside of my research I enjoy rock climbing, yoga, hiking, and painting.
